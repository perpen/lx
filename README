Next:
- merge config into lx.1, then can use default man target
- mkfiles: create a good install target
- client: timeout on server connection
- bash -i
- start lxsrv on boot
- work with vt - need pty? Check vt source.
- security: auth to lxsrv? use tls for encryption? and tls
  for auth?
- server: change getwinsize() to do what mc does on 9, so will
  work on acme or rio. But requires linking with libdraw for
  fontsize. No! the client can compute the size on demand.
- llpp
- review FIXMEs in code
- review all sysfatals, see if can be handled more gracefully.

Ports:
- name: ucpu?
- try with other vnc servers
- port to bsd
- reimplement with rc on linux??

Uses:
- plumb https://www.theguardian.com/uk
- use /dev/draw from linux
- use /net ?
- implement catclock on linux

Doc:
- man page
- can be used with any linux host, including probably vmx
- why linux? b/c i'm most familiar, b/c i only want to run
  apps and don't care about ecosystem, b/c it has most apps.
- compatibility problems: symlinks, lock files.
- first program in C in 20 years, first on plan9, advice
  appreciated.

Manual setup:
- mkdir/chown /mnt/lx /9 /usr/USER
- vnc xstartup: xhost +
- $PLAN9/bin/wintext: add: [ -f /9/dev/text ] && exec cat /9/dev/tex

General:
- which programs in ape could be replaced?
- new objtype "lx" so can add /xs/bin to path
- try kvik's x
- vncserver: security risk with xhost +?

README:
An approximate of the cpu command for running commands on a linux
host from 9.
We use linux mount namespaces and 9pfuse to make the current
9 namespace
available on the linux host. This is done for each invocation,
to provide more flexibility and a more 9-like experience.
Graphics
If a linux commands attempts to open its allocated X11 socket,
a VNC server is started on the fly, and a viewer on the 9 side.
Why Linux only?
Porting would be easy, but:
- The only Unix I'm familiar with.
- Most programs
- Unix environment doesn't matter (to me, atm)
Examples
- shell
- pipe to gawk
- go cross-compilation
- catclock
- browser
- plumber to browser
- Our mkfile.srv
Configuration
Sample file...
Security
None.
Setup and troubleshooting
See man page.

% aux/listen1 -tv tcp!*!3000 exportfs -dr / <[10=0] >[11=1] >[12=2]
$ bash -i </mnt/92/fd/10 >>/mnt/92/fd/11  2>>/mnt/92/fd/12
$ rc -i   </mnt/92/fd/10 >>/mnt/92/fd/11  2>>/mnt/92/fd/12
