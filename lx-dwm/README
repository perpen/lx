Modification for use with lx
============================
This is a simple customisation of dwm-6.2:
- Removed the tag buttons
- The status text (top right) is hardcoded to "X". Click with button 1
  closes the current window, with button 3 quits lx-dwm.
- Renamed to lx-dwm, to allow coexistence with original dwm

Below is the original dwm README content.


lx-dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
lx-dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build lx-dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (lx-dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install lx-dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running lx-dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start lx-dwm using startx:

    exec lx-dwm

In order to connect lx-dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec lx-dwm

(This will start lx-dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec lx-dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of lx-dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
